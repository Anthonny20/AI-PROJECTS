Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while
minimizing the risk, based on historical perfomance data and financial metrics.

# Getting Started
    Stock market portfolio involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining
    the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification. Using techniques such as Modern Portifolio Theory
     (MPT), we can construct an efficient portfolio that relies on the efficient frontier to represent the optimal trade-off between risk and return.

    The expected results from stock market portfolio optmization include identifying the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which indicates the best risk-adjusted return and provides a clear allocation strategy for the selected stocks to achieve long-term investment goals.

    To get started with stock market portfolio optmization, we need to collect data about the stock market perfomance over time. I will collect real-time stock market data using the yfinance API.

# Stock Market Portfolio Optimization with Python
    Now, let's get started with the task by importing the necessary Python libraries and collecting the stock market data using yfinance API. If you are about to use this API for the first time, you can install it on your Python enviroment by executing the command below on your terminal or command prompt:

    pip install yfinance
