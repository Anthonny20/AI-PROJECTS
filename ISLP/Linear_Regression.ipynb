    "This chapter is about linear regression, a very simple approach for supervised learning. In particular, linear regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response. It has been around for a long time and is the topic of innumerable textbooks. Though it may seen somewhat dull compared to some of the more mordern statistical learning approaches described in later chapters of this book, linear regression is still a useful and widely used statistical learning method. Moreover, it servers as a good jumping-off point for newer approaches: as we will see in later chapters, many fancy statistical learning approaches can be seen as generalizations or extensions of linear regression. Consequently, the importance of having a good understanding of linear regression before studying more complex learning methods cannot be overstated. In this chapter, we review some of the key ideas underlying the linear regression model, as well as the least squares approach that is most commonly used to fit this model.\n",
    "Recall the Advertising data from Chapter 2. Figure 2.1 displays sales(in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media. Suppose that in our role as statistical consultants we are asked to suggest, on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in high product sales. What information would be useful in order to provide such a recommendation? Here are a few important questions that we might seek to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?\n",
    "    Our first goal should be to determine whether the data provide evidence of an association between advertising expenditure and sales. If the evidence is weak, the one might argue that no money should be spent on advertising!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?\n",
    "    Assuming that there is a relationship between advertising and sales, we would like to know the strength of this relationship. Does knowledge of the advertising budget provide a lot of information about product sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which media are associated with sales?\n",
    "    Are all three media-TV, radio, and newspaper-associated with sales, or are just one or two of the media associated? To answer this question, we must find a way to separate out the individual contribution of each medium to sales when we have spent money on all three media.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How large is the association between each medium and sales?\n",
    "    For every dollar spent on advertising in particular medium, by what amount will sales increase? How accurately can we predict this amount of increase?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How accurately can we predict future sales?\n",
    "    For any given level of television, radio or newspaper advertising, what is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Is the relationship linear?\n",
    "    If there is approximately a straight-line relationship between advertising expenditure in the various media and sales, then linear regression is an appropriate tool. If not, then it may still be possible to transform the predictor or the response so that linear regression can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Is there synergy among the advertising media?\n",
    "    Perhaps spending $50,000 on television advertising and $50,000 on radio advertising is associated with higher sales than allocating $100,000 to either television or radio individually. In marketing, this is known as a synergy effect, while in statistics it is called an interaction effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that linear regression can be used to answer each of these questions. We will first discuss all of these questions in a general context, and then return to them in this specific context in Section 3.4."

    "Simple linear regression lives up to its name: it is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of a single predictor variable X. It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between X and Y. Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as \n",

Once we have used our training data to produce estimates βˆ0 and βˆ1 for the model coefficients, we can predict future sales on the basis of a particular value of TV advertising by computing\n",

In the Advertising example, this data set consists of the TV advertising budget and product sales in n = 200 different markets. (Recall that the data are displayed in Figure 2.1.) Our goal is to obtain coefficinet estimates βˆ0 and βˆ1 such that the linear model (3.1) fits the available data well, that is, so that yi ≈ βˆ0 + βˆ1xi for i = 1,...,n. In other words, we want to find an intercept βˆ0 and a slope βˆ1 such that the resulting line is as close as possible to the n = 200 data points. There are a number of ways of measuring closeness. However, by far the most common approach involves minimizing the least squares criterion, and we take that approach in this chapter. Alternative approaches will be considered in Chapter 6."
