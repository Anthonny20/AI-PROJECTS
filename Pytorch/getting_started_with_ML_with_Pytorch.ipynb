    "PyTorch is an open source framework for AI research and commercial production in machine learning. It is used to build, train and optmize deep learning neural networks for applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It provides computation support for CPU, GPU, parallel and distributed training on multiple GPUs and multiple nodes. PyTorch is also flexible and easily extensible, with specific libraries and tools available for many different domains. All of the above have made PyTorch a leading framework in machine learning."
